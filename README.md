Code and text of my Master Thesis: Needlet Multiple Testing for Point Source Detection in Planck CMB Anisotropy Maps.

This repository contains the result of my Master Thesis, conducted at University of Rome Tor Vergata within the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Programme AstroMundus.

Supervisors: Prof. Nicola Vittorio, Prof. Domenico Marinucci, Dr. Alessandro Buzzelli.

The most recent version of the text can be found in the file "Thesis.pdf", where the structure of the code is explained in Section 3.

As for now, the code is reported as-is and intended only for evaluation purposes. Although it can be used now, we are working in a simplied interface that will make the use of the code easier, more flexible, and possible more efficient. We hope to be able to have it ready as soon as possible.

For any question, please contact us at the current academic email of the author: Javier.Carron-Duque@student.uibk.ac.at

Abstract:
>The Cosmic Microwave Background is one of the most important sources of information about the Early Universe, since it is formed by photons emitted when the Universe was only \num{377000} years old. Observing it, however, entails several difficulties. One of them is the presence of unresolved point sources in the foreground. In this work, we implement a recent algorithm that takes advantage of needlet filtering and multiple testing Statistics. We create a flexible and complete programme and apply it to simulations and Planck anisotropy maps. In the simulations, the algorithm is able to recover essentially all point sources with an intensity above \numrange{3}{4} $\sigma$ with very low percentage of false detections. On the Planck maps, the algorithm detects a population of maxima incompatible with the assumed gaussianity of the Cosmic Microwave Background.
