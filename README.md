Code and text of my Master Thesis: Needlet Multiple Testing for Point Source Detection in Planck CMB Anisotropy Maps.

This repository contains the result of my Master Thesis, conducted at University of Rome Tor Vergata within the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Programme AstroMundus.
Author: Javier Carr√≥n Duque
Supervisors: Prof. Nicola Vittorio, Prof. Domenico Marinucci, Dr. Alessandro Buzzelli.

The most recent version of the text can be found in the file "Thesis.pdf", where the structure of the code is explained in Section 3.

As for now, the code is reported as-is and intended only for evaluation purposes. Although it can be used now, we are working in a simplied interface that will make the use of the code easier, more flexible, and possible more efficient. We hope to be able to have it ready as soon as possible.

For any question, please contact us at the current academic email of the author: Javier.Carron-Duque@student.uibk.ac.at
